# Project Health Analysis and Audit Report

## 1. Major Issues

### 1.1. Broken Build: `cad-convert` Module

The backend build is currently broken due to a missing dependency in the `cad-convert` module.

- **Issue:** The build fails with the error: `Could not resolve dependencies for project com.example:cad-convert:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT: Could not find artifact net.sourceforge:kabeja:jar:0.4`.
- **Impact:** This is a critical issue that prevents the application from being built and deployed. It also prevents any further analysis of the `cad-convert` module, including dependency vulnerability scanning and testing.
- **Reproducible Steps:**
  1. Run `mvn clean install` in the root directory of the project.
  2. The build will fail with a dependency resolution error in the `cad-convert` module.
- **Recommendation:** The missing `kabeja` dependency needs to be addressed. This might involve finding a new repository for the dependency, or replacing it with a different library.

### 1.2. Insecure File Uploads

The backend controllers do not validate the uploaded files, which is a major security risk.

- **Issue:** The controllers only check if the uploaded files are empty. They do not perform any validation of the file type, content, or size.
- **Impact:** A malicious user could upload a file that could cause a denial-of-service attack (e.g., by uploading a very large file) or execute arbitrary code on the server (e.g., by uploading a file with a malicious payload).
- **Recommendation:** Implement robust file validation on the backend. This should include checks for file type, content type, and size.

## 2. Minor Issues

### 2.1. Outdated and Inconsistent Dependencies

#### Frontend

- **Outdated Dependencies:** The frontend has a number of outdated dependencies, including major new versions of `react` and `react-dom`.
- **Deprecated Packages:** The `npm install` command shows warnings for several deprecated packages.
- **Vulnerability:** There is one low-severity vulnerability in the npm dependencies.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Run `npm outdated` to see a full list of outdated dependencies.
  - Run `npm audit` to see the details of the vulnerability.
  - Plan to update the dependencies to their latest versions.

#### Backend

- **Inconsistent Spring Boot Versions:** The `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` dependency is pulling in an older version of some Spring dependencies, which could cause subtle bugs.
- **Recommendation:** Investigate the dependency tree for the `springdoc` dependency and see if it can be updated to a version that is compatible with Spring Boot `3.4.0`.

### 2.2. Low Test Coverage

Both the frontend and backend have very low test coverage.

- **Frontend:** Only a small fraction of the features and components are covered by tests. There are no integration or E2E tests.
- **Backend:** The vast majority of the backend modules have no tests at all.
- **Impact:** The lack of test coverage makes it difficult to refactor the code or add new features without introducing regressions.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement a testing strategy for both the frontend and backend.
  - Add unit tests for all new code.
  - Add integration and E2E tests to cover the most critical user flows.

### 2.3. Code Quality and Anti-Patterns

#### Frontend

- **Lack of Lazy Loading:** The application does not use lazy loading for its feature components, which will lead to a large initial bundle size.
- **No Error Boundaries:** There are no `ErrorBoundary` components, which means that any unhandled error will crash the entire application.
- **Generic Error Handling:** The error handling is very generic and does not provide specific feedback to the user.

#### Backend

- **Fat Controllers:** The controllers contain a significant amount of business logic that should be in a separate service layer.
- **Lack of Dependency Injection:** The `CadConvertController` creates its own dependencies, making it hard to test.
- **Poor Error Handling:** The error handling is inconsistent and not robust.
- **Code Duplication:** The `PdfController` has a lot of duplicated code for handling file uploads.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Refactor the code to address these issues. This will improve the maintainability, reliability, and performance of the application.

## 3. Feature Status

- **`FEATURES.md` is Outdated:** The `FEATURES.md` file is outdated and does not accurately reflect the current state of the application.
- **CSV to JSON Converter is Frontend-only:** The CSV to JSON converter is implemented entirely on the frontend.
- **CAD Converter is Broken:** The CAD converter feature is completely broken.
- **Password Generator is Untested:** The password generator feature has not been tested.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Update the `FEATURES.md` file to accurately reflect the current state of the application.
  - Decide whether the CSV to JSON converter should be a backend feature or remain on the frontend.
  - Fix the CAD converter feature.
  - Test the password generator feature.

## 4. Security and Performance

### Security

- **Insecure File Uploads:** As mentioned in the "Major Issues" section, the backend does not validate uploaded files.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** The backend dependency vulnerability scan failed to run, so there may be undiscovered vulnerabilities in the backend dependencies.

### Performance

- **Frontend Bundle Size:** The frontend bundle size is likely to be large due to the lack of lazy loading.
- **Backend Performance:** The `CadConvertController` contains complex logic that could be a performance bottleneck.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Address the security and performance issues identified in this report.
  - Run a full dependency vulnerability scan on the backend once the build is fixed.
  - Implement lazy loading on the frontend.
  - Profile the backend to identify any performance bottlenecks.
