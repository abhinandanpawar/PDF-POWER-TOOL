# Recommended Tasks and Next Steps

This document outlines the recommended tasks for the next phase of development, prioritized by importance.

## High Priority

1.  **Fix Frontend Development Environment:**
    - The Vite development server (`npm run dev`) is currently broken, which is a critical blocker for any frontend work. This needs to be investigated and fixed immediately.

2.  **Address Insecure File Uploads:**
    - The audit report mentioned insecure file uploads. The backend needs to be updated to validate file types and sizes more robustly.
    - Implement filename sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks.

## Medium Priority

3.  **Implement Frontend Routing:**
    - Replace the current simple state management for views with `react-router-dom` to enable deep linking, improve navigation, and provide a better user experience.

4.  **Increase Backend Test Coverage:**
    - The audit report noted low test coverage. New unit and integration tests should be written for all backend services and controllers to improve code quality and prevent regressions.

## Low Priority

5.  **UI/UX Polish:**
    - **Improved User Feedback:** Enhance user feedback mechanisms, such as providing more informative loading indicators, success messages, and descriptive error notifications.
    - **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is fully responsive and usable on a variety of screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop monitors.

6.  **Complete Incomplete Modules:**
    - The `doc-convert` and `font-converter` modules were previously removed because they were incomplete. These modules should be completed and re-integrated into the application.
