# Project Status and Next Steps

This document outlines the current status of the project, the work that has been completed, and a recommended plan for future development.

## Completed Work

The following issues have been addressed:

*   **Backend Startup Failure:** The primary issue causing the backend to fail on startup has been resolved. The root cause was a dependency conflict between multiple logging frameworks (`commons-logging`, `log4j`, `slf4j`, `logback`). The fix involved:
    *   Excluding `commons-logging` from transitive dependencies.
    *   Adding the `jcl-over-slf4j` bridge to route all logging to SLF4J.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** The application's configuration has been centralized into a standard `application.properties` file in the main `app` module.
*   **Basic Logging Configuration:** A `logback-spring.xml` file has been added to provide a basic logging configuration.

## Unresolved Issues

### Silent Logging

While the application now starts and runs without crashing, it does so silently. The logging configuration is not being applied as expected, and no logs are being written to the console or to a file. This prevents proper monitoring and debugging of the application.

**Hypothesis:**

The issue is likely related to a subtle misconfiguration in the logging framework that is not being caught by the build process. It's possible that the `logback-spring.xml` file is not being loaded correctly, or that another configuration is overriding it.

## Recommended Plan for Future Development

1.  **Diagnose and Fix Silent Logging:** The highest priority is to diagnose and fix the silent logging issue. The following steps are recommended:
    *   **Verify Logging Configuration:** Double-check the `logback-spring.xml` file for any syntax errors or misconfigurations.
    *   **Explicitly Set Logging Configuration:** Use the `logging.config` property to explicitly set the path to the `logback-spring.xml` file when running the application.
    *   **Debug Classpath:** Use a debugger to inspect the classpath and determine which logging libraries are being loaded and in what order.
2.  **Increase Test Coverage:** The audit report noted low test coverage. Once the logging issue is resolved, new unit and integration tests should be written for all the backend services and controllers.
3.  **Implement Frontend Verification:** Create a Playwright or Cypress test suite to verify the frontend functionality and prevent regressions.
4.  **Address Insecure File Uploads:** The audit report mentioned insecure file uploads. The backend should be updated to validate file types and sizes more robustly and to sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks.
5.  **Complete Incomplete Modules:** The `doc-convert` and `font-converter` modules were removed because they were incomplete. These modules should be completed and re-integrated into the application.
