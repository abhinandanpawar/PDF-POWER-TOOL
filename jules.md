# Project Status and Next Steps

This document outlines the current status of the project, the work that has been completed, and the unresolved issues. It also provides a recommended plan for future development.

## Completed Work

The following issues identified in the audit reports have been addressed:

*   **Build Fix:** The backend build was failing due to missing and unregistered modules. This has been fixed by removing incomplete modules and correctly registering the existing `syntax-highlighter` module in the `pom.xml`. The application now builds successfully using `mvn clean install`.
*   **Backend Refactoring:** The "fat controller" issue in `PdfController.java` has been resolved by creating a `PdfService.java` to handle business logic, such as file validation and input stream conversion. This has simplified the controller and improved code quality. Logging has also been added to the controller and service.
*   **Dependency Updates:**
    *   **Frontend:** All frontend dependencies have been updated to their latest versions using `npm audit fix`.
    *   **Backend:** The `jhighlight` dependency in the `syntax-highlighter` module has been updated.
*   **Frontend Performance:** Lazy loading has been implemented for all tool views in `App.tsx` using `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense` to improve initial load times.
*   **Documentation:** A comprehensive `README.md` has been created with a project description, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.
*   **Security:** A search for hardcoded secrets was conducted, and no sensitive credentials were found.

## Unresolved Issues

### Backend Application Fails to Start

The primary unresolved issue is that the Spring Boot application fails to start.

**Symptoms:**

*   When running `java -jar app/target/app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`, the application hangs and eventually times out.
*   The log file (`backend.log`) often shows a "Standard Commons Logging discovery in action" message, but no other meaningful errors are logged.
*   Attempts to run the application on different ports (e.g., 8081, 8082) have been unsuccessful.
*   Debugging with `jstack` did not provide a clear root cause.

**Hypothesis:**

The issue is likely related to a dependency conflict or a misconfiguration in the Spring Boot application that is not being logged correctly. The "Standard Commons Logging" message might be a red herring, but it could also indicate a class loading issue.

## Recommended Plan for Future Development

1.  **Diagnose the Startup Issue:** The highest priority is to diagnose and fix the backend startup problem. The following steps are recommended:
    *   **Simplify the Application:** Create a minimal `main` method in `PdfProcessorApplication.java` that only starts the Spring Boot application without any custom configurations. Gradually add back configurations to isolate the problem.
    *   **Dependency Analysis:** Use `mvn dependency:tree` to analyze the full dependency tree and look for conflicting versions of libraries, especially logging-related ones.
    *   **Remote Debugging:** If possible, attach a remote debugger to the application during startup to step through the initialization process.
2.  **Increase Test Coverage:** The audit report noted low test coverage. Once the application is running, new unit and integration tests should be written for all the backend services and controllers.
3.  **Implement Frontend Verification:** Create a Playwright or Cypress test suite to verify the frontend functionality and prevent regressions.
4.  **Address Insecure File Uploads:** The audit report mentioned insecure file uploads. The backend should be updated to validate file types and sizes more robustly and to sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks.
5.  **Complete Incomplete Modules:** The `doc-convert` and `font-converter` modules were removed because they were incomplete. These modules should be completed and re-integrated into the application.
