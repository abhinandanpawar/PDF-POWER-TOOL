# What I Have Done

I have successfully completed Task 5, "JavaScript Web Utilities," by implementing the features outlined in Phase A of the project plan. This involved adding a new suite of client-side developer tools to the application.

## New Features

I have added a new "Developer Tools" category to the application, which includes the following tools:

1.  **Visual Diff Viewer:** This tool allows users to compare two blocks of text and highlights the differences between them. It features a side-by-side view for easy comparison.

2.  **JSON Formatter:** This tool can be used to format or minify JSON data. It helps in making JSON readable or compacting it for transmission.

3.  **Data Cleaner:** This tool provides several basic text cleaning operations, such as trimming whitespace from each line, removing duplicate lines, and converting text to uppercase or lowercase.

4.  **Config Converter:** This tool allows users to convert between different configuration formats, including JSON, YAML, and XML.

## Technical Implementation

To implement these features, I followed these steps:

1.  **Installed Dependencies:** I added the following libraries to the project:
    *   `react-diff-viewer-continued`: For rendering the diff view.
    *   `js-yaml` and `@types/js-yaml`: For handling YAML parsing and stringification.
    *   `xml-js`: For converting between XML and JSON.

2.  **Updated Core Files:**
    *   `types.ts`: I added a new `Developer` category to the `ToolCategory` enum and new keys for each of the developer tools to the `Tool` enum.
    *   `constants.tsx`: I added a new section for "Developer Tools" to the `TOOLS` array, including titles, descriptions, and icons for each new tool. I used icons from the `lucide-react` library.
    *   `App.tsx`: I imported the new tool components and added them to the main `switch` statement to enable navigation to them.

3.  **Created New Components:** I created a new React component for each of the tools in the `features` directory:
    *   `DiffViewerView.tsx`
    *   `JsonFormatterView.tsx`
    *   `DataCleanerView.tsx`
    *   `ConfigConverterView.tsx`

Each component is self-contained and handles its own state and logic. They all use the existing `ToolPageLayout` component for a consistent look and feel.

I have completed all the work for Phase A. The new tools are integrated into the application and are ready for use.
