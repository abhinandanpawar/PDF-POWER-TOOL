# Architectural Audit Report

## 1. Overall Architecture Audit

The application follows a modern, but flawed, architecture. It consists of a React-based single-page application (SPA) for the frontend and a Java-based multi-module monolith for the backend. While this is a common and valid architectural pattern, the implementation has several issues that affect the project's health, maintainability, and security.

### 1.1. High-Level Architecture

- **Frontend:** The frontend is a standard React application built with Vite. It uses `react-router-dom` for routing and appears to have a component-based structure.
- **Backend:** The backend is a Spring Boot application structured as a multi-module Maven project. This is a good approach for separating concerns, with different modules for different functionalities (e.g., `pdf-merge`, `pdf-split`). The main `app` module then integrates these modules to expose a REST API.

### 1.2. Key Architectural Issues

- **Incomplete and Broken Build:** The most critical issue is that the project is not in a buildable state. The `cad-convert` module, which is referenced in the build configuration, is entirely missing from the codebase. This is a fundamental issue that prevents the application from being built, tested, or deployed.
- **Lack of a Service Layer:** The backend controllers contain business logic that should be in a separate service layer. This makes the controllers "fat" and harder to test and maintain.
- **Inadequate Testing:** The testing strategy is insufficient. The backend's core business logic is largely untested, and the frontend has very low test coverage. This poses a significant risk of regressions and makes future development and refactoring difficult.
- **Poor Dependency Management:** Both the frontend and backend have outdated dependencies, with potential security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Backend Java Audit

### 2.1. Code Quality and Anti-Patterns

- **Fat Controllers & Code Duplication:** The `PdfController` is a prime example of these issues. It contains duplicated code for file validation and input stream conversion, and it handles logic that should be in a service layer.
- **Missing Module:** The `cad-convert` module is missing, which is a critical issue.
- **Inconsistent Dependencies:** The backend has inconsistent Spring Boot versions due to the `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` dependency.

### 2.2. Security

- **Insecure File Uploads:** The backend controllers do not validate uploaded files, which is a major security risk.

### 2.3. Recommendations

- **Restore or Remove `cad-convert`:** The missing module must be restored from version control or removed from the build if it's no longer needed.
- **Refactor Controllers:** Extract business logic from controllers into a dedicated service layer.
- **Implement File Validation:** Add robust file validation to the backend.
- **Update Dependencies:** Update all backend dependencies to their latest stable versions.

## 3. UI Audit

### 3.1. Architecture and Performance

- **Lack of Lazy Loading:** The frontend does not use lazy loading for its feature components, which will result in a large initial bundle size and slow initial page load. This is a major performance bottleneck.
- **Good Error Handling:** Contrary to the initial health report, the application has a well-implemented `ErrorBoundary` component, which is a strong point.

### 3.2. Dependencies

- **Outdated Dependencies:** The `package.json` file shows several outdated dependencies, including `react`, `react-dom`, and `vite`. This can lead to security vulnerabilities and prevent the use of new features.

### 3.3. Recommendations

- **Implement Lazy Loading:** Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load feature components on demand.
- **Update Dependencies:** Update all frontend dependencies to their latest stable versions.

## 4. Testing Audit

### 4.1. Frontend Testing

- **Coverage:** Test coverage is extremely low. Only a few of the many features have any tests.
- **Quality:** The existing tests are of high quality, using modern tools and best practices.
- **Recommendations:** Implement a comprehensive testing strategy with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

### 4.2. Backend Testing

- **Coverage:** Test coverage is critically low. The core business logic in the library modules is completely untested.
- **Quality:** The existing integration tests are good but only cover the "happy path".
- **Recommendations:** Add unit tests for all services and utilities, and expand integration tests to cover error cases.
